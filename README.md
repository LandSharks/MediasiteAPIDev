# MediasiteAPIDev
Project given to me by IRT Learning Space Services and one of the first big projects worked on. Employer was kind enough to allow me to post this to my GitHub with the condition that all HTTP requests, emails, and URLS are removed for security purposes.

In retro-spec after spending two years improving my skill set this was a very poorly implemented project. Given my restrictions to the web server (i.e. me not being able to change a single thing) and the manager insisting we use PHP, I tried the best I could but the run time on this form is still incredibly hefty with no asynchronous calls. In addition to that: embedded PHP? I would prefer to avoid that.

Should I ever face a project like this in the future, I would like to place heavier emphasis on front / back removing the php entirely and creating an angular page or even using something even more light weight as there are not many reactive elements.
